## Notes

This is adopted version of [YtScrollFix](https://github.com/wazeerc/fixYtScroll) extension made by [wazeerc](https://github.com/wazeerc) to Tampermonkey. The reason I adopted this for Tampermonkey is that I do like using extensions but I do not like to install them all seperately. Tampermonkey does all the job itself for me.
